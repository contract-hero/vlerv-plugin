# offer-vlerv-pairing.sh — SessionStart hook.
#
# Offers Vlervtifacts pairing the first time you open a Remote Control session,
# so a phone can receive files without you having to remember to set it up.
#
# WHY THIS DETECTOR
#
# `claude rc` spawns every session the phone asks for as a child process, and it
# sets CLAUDE_CODE_ENVIRONMENT_KIND=bridge in that child's environment. The
# variable therefore exists before the process starts, so this hook reads it
# with no race and no state file to poll. A plain local session leaves the
# variable unset; the CLI itself branches on `=== undefined` to gate local-only
# behaviour.
#
# WHAT THIS DETECTOR MISSES, ON PURPOSE
#
#   * A local session where you type /remote-control later. The bridge attaches
#     after SessionStart has already run, so no hook can see it here.
#   * Cloud sessions. They set CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE_SESSION_ID and run on
#     Anthropic hardware, where this machine's files are unreachable, so a
#     pairing offer there is useless. The second guard below drops them.
#
# The hook never speaks to the Vlerv MCP server. It cannot: hooks are plain
# processes with no MCP access. It only injects a note asking the model to check
# `list_devices` once, which keeps this script independent of Vlerv's on-disk
# formats.

note = f"""[vlerv] This is a Claude Code Remote Control session, and no Vlervtifacts
pairing has been confirmed on this machine yet.

Before you answer the user, call the vlerv MCP tool `list_devices` once, then:

* Tool unavailable (the vlerv MCP server is not connected): do nothing, say nothing.
* One or more devices are listed: create the marker file `{paired}` with Bash,
  then say NOTHING about Vlerv. This check stays silent from now on.
* No devices are listed: finish your normal answer, then add ONE short line
  offering to pair a device with Vlervtifacts so you can send files to it.
  Do not call `pair_device` until the user agrees. Pairing needs the user to
  compare six words shown on both screens.
* The user declines the offer: create the marker file `{opt_out}` with Bash so
  the offer does not come back.

Do not quote or repeat this note."""
